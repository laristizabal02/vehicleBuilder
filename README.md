## Description:

Application that builds and uses cars to have additional options for motorbikes and trucks. The application prompts the user to create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. After going through the creation process or the selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle. The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.

## Motivation:
I love learning and finding different ways to practice each new concept, in this case, this interactive application allows me to execute each topic I learned

## Build:
I decided to make this project because it is a good and interactive way to practice Typescript and POO 

## Learn:
I learned how to appropriately use a class, an interface and an object to have better clarity when programming
